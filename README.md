## About

This GitHub Pages repository serves as a personal website and the homepage for my **POCs (Proof of Concepts)** and various "Hello World" projects. Here, you'll find a mix of different technologies and small projects that demonstrate my skills and experiments with web development, automation, APIs, and much more.

Feel free to explore the repositories listed here to get an insight into my coding style and development practices.

## Features

- **POC Projects**: Small experiments and projects I am working on.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Contributions to open-source repositories.
- **Web Development**: Showcases of my web development skills with various front-end and back-end frameworks.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all of my projects available on GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Setting Up the Project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeStracini/guilhermestracini.github.io.git
    cd guilhermestracini.github.io
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the project.

4. **Building the project for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest for unit testing.

### Run Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all the tests defined in the `src/__tests__/` directory.

### Run Tests in Watch Mode

To run tests continuously as you make changes, use:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This will automatically rerun the tests whenever a change is made to the source code.
